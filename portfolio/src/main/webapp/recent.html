      <h2 align= left> Morgan Stanley Early Insights Program</h2>
      <p>I was accepted to a selective program in Morgan Stanley's New York office for a 
        weekend of problem solving, network building, and financial services exploration. 
        With an acceptance rate below 10%, this program allowed me to connect with some of 
        my brightest peers in finance. However, occuring near the start of the COVID-19 
        crisis, the program transitioned into an online format, emphasizing mentorship and 
        building pragmatic experience.

      <p> During my internship as a Project Management Intern, I reported directly to the 
        COO on high-profile projects with the General Services Administration, Chicago 
        Park District, and Chicago Public Schools. I established myself within the 
        construction industry while managing and dealing with more experienced 
        contractors. I ensured and maintained new construction timeline with delegation 
        and planning between construction companies and clients. Over the course of my 
        internship, I worked on 17 projects totalling over $1M in revenue. I proudly 
        accomplished new construction in hurting and impoverished neighborhoods in South 
        Chicago as well as the Downtown Loop area. In this photo I am standing atop the 
        Marshall Field and Company Building, as part of a project I was on.

      <p> Stanford Splash is a student run education program aimed at area high schoolers 
        and middle schoolers. Classes are taught by Stanford students in areas of their 
        choosing. This year, I cotaught a class called <em> "AI and Machine Learning 101" </em> 
        giving an introductory look at current machine learning models and theories at a 
        high level of abstraction.

      <p> Collaborated on case-studies and understandings of workplace diversity & inclusion 
        with 21 students from 15 institutions nation-wide. Gained a community of fellow 
        undergraduates interested in consulting, hailing from other underrepresented and 
        blue-collar communities. Supported by mentoring McKinsey Analysts, recruiters, 
        and interns. Accepted out of competitive and dense applicant pool.

      </a>
      <p> <em>THINKChicago</em> is a program presented by Lori Lightfoot, the University 
        of Illinois System, World Business Chicago, and Lollapalooza, inviting 200 of the 
        nation's top tech talent to Chicago. Here, I cultivated synergy and creativity towards 
        high-profile problems pressing Chicago’s Mayor’s Office within a 6-person team 
        comprising of different teams. While assigned a “difficult” and “unattractive” issue 
        of Last Mile Transportation, we succeeded in becoming pitch finalist to advise Mayor 
        Lightfoot while acting as Team Co-Presenter. Accepted out of competitive and dense 
        application pool.
